# MoAI-ADK Product Overview

## What is MoAI-ADK?

MoAI-ADK (MoAI Agentic Development Kit) is a Claude Code-native development framework that automates the entire software development lifecycle through a 4-stage pipeline: project initialization, specification creation, TDD implementation, and documentation synchronization.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Complete Workflow Automation**: From `/moai:0-project` to `/moai:3-sync` - automates specification writing, TDD implementation, and living documentation
- **TRUST 5 Principles**: Enforces Test-first, Readable, Unified, Secured, and Trackable development practices
- **16-Core @TAG System**: Provides complete traceability from requirements to implementation through structured tagging
- **Dual Mode Operation**: Personal mode (checkpoint-based) and Team mode (GitFlow + PR automation)

## Target Users

- **Individual Developers**: Seeking structured development processes and automated quality gates
- **Development Teams**: Requiring consistent workflows, code quality, and collaboration efficiency
- **Claude Code Users**: Looking for native integration with AI-assisted development environments

## Key Features

### 4-Stage Development Pipeline
1. **Project Setup** (`/moai:0-project`): Interactive project initialization with brainstorming support
2. **Specification** (`/moai:1-spec`): EARS-pattern specification generation with @TAG linking
3. **Implementation** (`/moai:2-build`): TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle with quality gates
4. **Synchronization** (`/moai:3-sync`): Living documentation and deployment preparation

### Agent Ecosystem
- **project-manager**: Project setup and configuration
- **spec-builder**: Specification creation and management
- **code-builder**: TDD implementation and quality assurance
- **doc-syncer**: Documentation synchronization and reporting
- **git-manager**: Version control and branch management

### Quality Assurance
- Automated TRUST 5 principles enforcement
- 85%+ test coverage requirements
- 16-Core @TAG traceability system
- Integrated security scanning and code quality checks

## Success Metrics

- **Development Speed**: 50% reduction in feature development time
- **Code Quality**: 80% reduction in production bugs
- **Team Efficiency**: 50% faster code reviews and onboarding
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 85%+ coverage across all projects
